# Invaders

The main objective was to create a simple and minimalist Space Invaders-style game using only C++. However, due to the heavily Blueprint-oriented nature of the Unreal Engine ecosystem, writing clean C++ code proved to be challenging at times.

In the end, I had to resort to using Blueprints for creating a few dynamic materials and animating UI elements, but all the game logic was implemented in C++.

I would have liked to add some basic particle effects and a HUD to the game, due to quick bug fixes and like of time, the code started becoming messy. Additionally, the Unreal Engine proved to be quite heavy, and development was slow, especially at the beginning. It seems that a lighter engine may be better for a game of this level, both technically and visually.

This was my first attempt at creating a game using the Unreal Engine, and although it was occasionally incomplete, I am ultimately satisfied with the end result.
